# Introduction 
I am a DBC student at Fontys Tilburg and for a class I had to make a project and create a GitHub. This is my first time using GitHub and even using JavaScript and GSAP used in this project. The assignment was really open and we had to come up with our own project. Because I was searching for a new phone that day I decided to make a project around the OnePlus 7. I made a simple advertisement using GSAP and JavaScript. I had no experience starting this project and this is wat I created. That's why I am always open for feedback!

# Getting started
To see my working project you first have to download all the files on my github page. Be sure that all the folders are saved correctly to prevent any errors. Because of some issues you have to open the Index.html file with Google Chrome. This will give you the best results.

# Usage
I get that you would want to change some things in my project or see how I did it, that's why I tried to put comments on top of every couple of lines in the coding. The codes overall are pretty standard and self explanitory.
